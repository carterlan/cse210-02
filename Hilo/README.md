# Hilo

Are you willing to risk everything? The game is simple. The player must guess if the next card
is going to be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are earned based on whether the
player guessed correctly or not.

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 Hilo

```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
